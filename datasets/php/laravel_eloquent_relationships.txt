<?php
// User.php
class User extends Model {
    public function posts() {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}

// Post.php
class Post extends Model {
    public function user() {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}

// Usage
$user = User::find(1);
foreach ($user->posts as $post) {
    echo $post->title;
}
?>
This example defines a one-to-many relationship between User and Post models in Laravel and fetches all posts for a given user.
